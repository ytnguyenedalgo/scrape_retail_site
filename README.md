# scrape_retail_site
5-Week Coder Final Project: Scrape Retail Site 

Run the "ScrapeRetailSite.py" to scrape, save, and search through data gotten from www.macys.com

The "apikey.py" is a module written for "ScrapeRetailSite.py" to obtain user's API key from www.scraperapi.com

A small sample of data outputs from "ScrapeRetailSite.py" were collected and stored in "macys-product.cvs"
